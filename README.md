# Marvel Characters
This repository provides a mobile application sources code developed by Flutter for Android and ios devices. Contains The main page presents a list of Marvel Characters and The details page can be reached by clicking on each item.

The BloC pattern is used to develop this app. It is one of the most popular patterns to develop Flutter applications. It uses streams but I don't use them to avoid having a complex source but it helps a lot in big projects.

The repository pattern is used for data access logic, so the source code can be extended without any modification in old classes.

Below are some packages used in the source code : 
  - go_router to navigating between screens.
  - flutter_i18next to simplify the i18n process.
  - get_it to handle dependency injection.
  - dio to HTTP requests.
  - flutter_bloc to implement BloC pattern

and some other packages to make development faster and easier. This set of packages does not mean they are the best, but pub likes, popularity and points 
states that they are used in many projects and do their responsibilities.

The source code contains unit tests for logical parts of it.

The UI could be improved, but due to logical importance and lack of time, I decided to focus on the logic.

In the end, it takes about 24 hours to analyze, plan and develop this app and I'm open to receiving comments about how can I make the source code better.
